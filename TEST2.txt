8. The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to each question-
My own recollection is that I had not any high regard for my ability. I used to be astonished whenever I won prizes and scholarships. But I very jealously guarded my character. The least little blemish drew tears from my eyes. When I merited, or seemed to the teacher to merit, a rebuke, it was unbearable for me. I remember having once received corporal punishment.I did not so much mind the punishment, as the fact that it was considered my desert. I wept piteously. That was when I was in the first or second standard.
There was another such incident during the time when I was in the seventh standard. DorabjiEduljiGimi was the headmaster then. He was popular among boys, as he was a disciplinarian, a man of method and a good teacher. He had made gymnastics and cricket compulsory for boys of the upper standards. I disliked both. I never took part in any exercise, cricket or football, before they were made compulsory.My shyness was one of the reasons for this aloofness, which I now see was wrong. I then had the false notion that gymnastics had nothing to do with education. Today I know that physical training should have as much place in the curriculum as mental training.

Why did the author say that he did not have any high regard for his ability?
